This file contains **Wokwi simulation links** for various LED-based projects implemented using **Bare Metal Embedded C**.



## Project List

### [LED Blinking](https://wokwi.com/projects/422254429633147905)
💡 A basic project to blink an LED at a fixed interval.

### [Even LED Glow](https://wokwi.com/projects/422251815356660737)
💡 Even-numbered LEDs glow simultaneously in this pattern-based project.

### [LED Blink Sequentially](https://wokwi.com/projects/422294787898091521)
💡 LEDs blink one after another in a sequential pattern.

### [8-LED Binary Representation (0000 to 1111)](https://wokwi.com/projects/422221318000072705)
💡 Displays binary counting using 8 LEDs, ranging from `0000` to `1111`.
