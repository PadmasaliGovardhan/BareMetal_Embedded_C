## **8x8 Dot Matrix Using LED** 

This project demonstrates an **8x8 LED Dot Matrix** display, implemented using Bare Metal Embedded C.

### **Project Overview**
Controls an **8x8 LED Dot Matrix** to display patterns or characters.
Implemented with **direct GPIO manipulation**.
Suitable for learning about **multiplexing and LED matrix driving techniques**.
All Codes(Print Heart Symbol, Print from 0 to 9, Print from A to Z) in one Project.
